# README

DuckDuckBooze is a four person group project that is part of the Turing School of Sofware and
Design's Backend Engineering Module 2 curriculum.  The aim of the project is to hone the following skills:

- Advanced Rails routing (nested resources and namespacing)
- Advanced ActiveRecord for calculating statistics
- Average HTML/CSS layout and design for UX/UI
- Session management and use of POROs for shopping cart
- Authentication, Authorization, separation of user roles and permissions

The project is an Rails application that acts as an e-commerce platform where users can place items into a shopping cart and check out to purchase the items if they have also registered. Merchants can specify items as "fulfilled" and the last merchant to do this for a specific order will automatically set the current order status (enum) to "shipped". Each user will have roles; these roles vary the user's authorization to access some functionality within the models.
